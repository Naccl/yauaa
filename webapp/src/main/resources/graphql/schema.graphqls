YAUAA: YET ANOTHER USERAGENT ANALYZER

This is a java library that tries to parse and analyze the useragent string (and when available the User-Agent Client Hints) and extract as many relevant attributes as possible.

The full documentation can be found here https://yauaa.basjes.nl

WARNING: This MUST be treated as an INSECURE and UNSTABLE proof of concept.
